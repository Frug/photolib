# PhotoLib

Not Quite Pinterest

This app consists of two services that run locally. The react app listens on port 3000 and the go side on 8081.

To start locally, use `start-local.sh`.

If you don't have go 1.12 and the build fails, the binary is included at `go/photolib` and can be started manually without building.

Use `dump-photos.sh` to dump a set of dummy photos to start with.
